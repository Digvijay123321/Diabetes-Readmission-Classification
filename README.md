# Identifying High-Risk Diabetes Patients: A Classification Model for Hospital Readmissions

## Overview
Diabetes is a major chronic condition that affects millions worldwide. Despite advancements in healthcare, inconsistent hospital management, particularly in glycemic control, often leads to frequent readmissions, raising healthcare costs and affecting patient outcomes. This project aims to build a predictive model to identify the likelihood of hospital readmission among diabetic patients.

## Objective
The goal is to classify hospital readmissions based on patient data:
- **No Readmission**
- **Readmission within 30 days**
- **Readmission after 30 days**

By predicting early readmissions, healthcare providers can implement interventions to reduce unnecessary readmissions and improve overall patient care.

## Dataset: [Diabetes 130-US Hospitals for Years 1999-2008](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/296/diabetes+130-us+hospitals+for+years+1999-2008)
- **Timeframe**: 1999â€“2008
- **Sources**: 130 US hospitals and integrated delivery networks
- **Instances**: 101,766 diabetic patient records
- **Features**: 47, including demographic information, clinical test results, medications, and outcomes.

## Approach
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing values
   - Encode categorical variables
   - Normalize/standardize numerical features
   - Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Analyze feature distributions
   - Identify correlations and patterns
   - Visualize target variable distribution

3. **Feature Selection**:
   - Use techniques like correlation analysis and feature importance
   - Consider dimensionality reduction techniques if needed

4. **Model Development**:
   - Build and compare models: Multinomial Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests
   - Develop algorithms using Pandas and NumPy

5. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
   - Visualize results with confusion matrices
   - Apply stratified k-fold cross-validation for robustness

6. **Hyperparameter Tuning (Optional)**:
   - Fine-tune parameters for optimal performance

7. **Results Analysis**:
   - Interpret key factors influencing readmissions
   - Analyze misclassifications
